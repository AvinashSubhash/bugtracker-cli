# bugtracker-cli

bugtracker-cli is a command-line tool for tracking bugs in a program. It is written in Python and uses sqlite3 as a database to store information about the bugs. The tool allows you to record the time at which the bug was found, the number of days the bug was open, the closing date of the bug, the importance of the bug, the project name of the bug, and the category of the bug. It is a useful tool for helping software developers keep track of and manage the bugs in their programs.
